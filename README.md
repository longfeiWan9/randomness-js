## randomness-js

A convenience library for retrieving, verifying and deriving randomness from the dcrypt network.

Build everything by running `npm run build`. This creates a dist directory containing commonjs and esm modules.

Solidity interfaces for randomness can be found in our [solidity repo](https://github.com/randa-mu/randamu-solidity-contracts).
